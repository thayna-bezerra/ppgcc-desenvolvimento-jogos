/**
 * @file PathFind.hpp
 * @brief A* shortest path over an integer tile matrix.
 *
 * The matrix is row-major (index = row*width + col); a cell is WALKABLE iff its
 * value is EMPTY_TILE. The matrix is referenced, not copied, and must outlive
 * this object.
 *
 * Search uses 8-CONNECTIVITY (orthogonal and diagonal moves). A diagonal move
 * between two cells is included only when BOTH cells orthogonally adjacent to
 * that diagonal are also empty, so a path never clips the corner of a wall.
